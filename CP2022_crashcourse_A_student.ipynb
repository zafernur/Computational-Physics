    "# Tutorial A: Getting started with Python\n",
    "Welcome to the first week of Computational Physics. The file in front of your is a python 'Notebook', which is an environment that combines live coding with text. During the course, we will supply the tutorials using these notebooks. The first week of the course does not come with formal lectures, but instead consists of three tutorials, aimed at making you familiar with the Python programming language. These tutorials are by no means meant as a complete introduction to Python: rather they should be seen as a brief introduction/reference that enables a further self-study where necessary. These first three tutorials are compiled using examples from freely available Python tutorials, which we link to at the end of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose to run these notebooks in the cloud using Google Colaboratory (Colab), or on your own machine using the Jupyter Notebook software itself. Other options (not recommended) are to use an integrated development environment like Spyder, or write local Python scripts and run them from the command line/via an interpeter. We will assume you are using Colab throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks contain cells which can be edited. To edit a text cell, double click to enter Edit Mode. To edit a code cell, simply click on it. To execute a code cell, you can either press ctrl+Enter from within the cell. Alternatively, some run-options are found in the 'Runtime' menu at the top of the Colab interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims of this tutorial\n",
    "To get familiar with:\n",
    "- Basic python syntax, assigning data types\n",
    "- The programming environment, managing packages\n",
    "- Logical flow (i.e. loops) in Python\n",
    "- Defining functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some notes:\n",
    "* We tried to provide examples where possible. You should be careful with copying, you should not always copy the variable names literally.\n",
    "* The tutorial is quite long. If you are familiar with certain aspects, you are free to skip some parts. In the end, this crash course is only meant to get you familiar with the basics, not to bore you!\n"

    "- Python also has built-in support for complex numbers (i.e. you can use 5+3j to set a complex part 3 to a real part 5). In fact, all numerical datatypes have a `real` and `imag` attribute that gives you the real and imaginary parts respectively. You can access these with `var.real` and `var.imag`.\n",

    "1. Consider the string of text: *Isn't Computational Physics Great?* . Since it contains an apostrophe, a simple `someString='Isn't Computational Physics Great?'` will not work (try it below). Use either the `\\` symbol in front of the apostrophe, or double quotation marks to define `someString` and print the output.\n",

    " **Note:** By default, `split` separates at white space. You can provide an argument to split on occurrence of another character. For example, `string.split(\",\")` will split on occurrence of commas. This can be very handy when dealing with comma-separated values!\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Lists are groups of values. They are defined by square brackets `[` and `]`. Create a list `fibonacci` containing the first 10 entries of the Fibonacci sequence  \n",
    "```\n",
    "fibonacci = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "and print it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can access individual entries in a list by indexing as follows: `list[index]`. Print the first, 5th and last entry of the Fibonacci sequence defined above. Note that you can count forward (starting from 0) or backward (starting from -1). Try both!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can also acces multiple entries at once by using `list[a:b]` or `list[a:b:c]`where `a` and `b` are indices as before, and `c` is a step size which is 1 if not specified. You can also leave out either `a`, `b` or both. Try this, and see what happens. Again, counting can be done forward or backward. What happens if `c` becomes negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \n",
    " a. Make two 'copies' of your list: The first by `incorrectCopy = fibonacci` and another by `correctCopy = oldList[:]` or `correctCopy = oldList.copy()`. Print all three lists next to each other. (The names will become clear in the next subquestion.)\n",
    " \n",
    " b. You can change individual list entries by using `fibonacci[index]=newValue`. Multiple entries can also be updated similarly: `fibonacci[indexRange] = newValues`. Make some changes to your *copied* lists. After each change, print all three lists next to each other. What happens? \n",
    "\n",
    " **Note:** Python variables are actually pointers. So, when updating *mutable* variables (like lists) you should keep in mind that you're actually changing the object it points to! For other objects, like ints and floats, this will not happen. You can find out if variables point to the same object by evaluating `variable1 is variable2` (try it).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Lists contain helpful methods like `list.append()`, `list.insert()` and `list.remove()`.  You can find out about how to use these by typing `help(list)` in an interactive Python environment (like Jupyter and Colaboratory). We will treat this further in the third tutorial of this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** \n",
    " - You might be tempted to think of lists as vectors (especially if you are used to MATLAB), but note that each list entry can be of a different data types, and lists may even be nested. This may tempt you to use (nested) lists as matrices in calculations, but this is NOT good practice. It is much better to use the Numpy package (below) for this, as this is a streamlined package for vector calculations.\n",
    " - The `+` operator concatenates lists, e.g. `[1,2] + ['a','b']` will yield `[1,2,'a','b']`.\n",
    " - In Python, there is also a closely related built-in data structure, namely tuples (defined by `()`). These are the immutable versions of lists, you could say (i.e., you cannot change an element or append a number to a tuple).\n",

    "### NumPy in a nutshell\n",
    "The Numerical Python package has several benefits over working with normal Python lists. This package contains a lot of functionality that is similar to matlab, see also [this comparison](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not done so, import numpy with `import numpy as np`.\n",
    "1. Compare the value and type of `x1 = range(1,10)` and `x2 = np.arange(1,10)`. You will see that the numpy array belongs to the `ndarray` class, which represents vectors and matrices.\n",
    "2. Variables of the `ndarray` class can be used  directly in vector and matrix computations (much like in MATLAB). For example, the elements of an `ndarray` can be squared using `Array**2`. No loops required, not even list comprehension!\n",
    "3. As the name suggests, `ndarray`s can be *n*-dimensional, for example matrices. You can generate matrices and vectors using for example\n",
    "```\n",
    "M = np.array([[2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 1], [0, 1, 2]])\n",
    "I = np.identity(3)\n",
    "x = np.ones((1,3))\n",
    "y = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Do this and calculate Mx, Iy, and the outer expansion of xy. *Hint:* you can perform matrix multiplication using the `np.dot()` function or the `@` operator. A vector can be tranposed using `vec.T` or `np.transpose(vec)`.\n",
    "4. Use the `help()` function to learn more about all the methods and attributes an `ndarray` has. Print e.g. the size and shape of the arrays of the previous subquestion.\n",
